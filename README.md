# Commit Protocol

Immutable on-chain commits. Irreversible by design.

Commit Protocol is a minimal on-chain protocol that allows users to permanently
record human-readable messages directly on the blockchain.

Once committed, data cannot be edited, deleted, or overwritten.

## Why Commit Protocol?

Posts can disappear.
Commits don’t.

Commit Protocol exists to create a permanent, censorship-resistant layer
for statements, promises, critiques, and historical records.
